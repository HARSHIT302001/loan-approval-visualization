# loan-approval-visualization
Visual data analysis of home loan approval trends using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn.
This project focuses on performing a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a home loan approval dataset. The goal is to uncover patterns, visualize trends, and derive actionable insights using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

No machine learning models were used â€” just powerful visual storytelling with data.
